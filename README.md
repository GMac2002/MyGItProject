Khalid and Garrett will be creating two python programs called SoliMacProject.py and MacSoliProject.py

One python program (SoliMacProject.py) in which the user will be asked if they prefer the average or sum process more. If they answer with average, a function will find the average of 5 randomly generated numbers. The same will happen for sum. If they answer with an invalid input, one of the 2 operations will happen randomly, with a 1/3 chance for average and a 2/3 chance for summation.

The other Python program (MacSoliProject.py) will allow the user to perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, or multiplication) on a custom list of numbers. The user will specify the number of inputs, and the program will store them in a NumPy array before performing the selected operation.

Garrett will make the main body of SoliMacProject.py, Khalid will be responsible for the average and sum functionality.
