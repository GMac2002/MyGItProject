# MyGitProjectFinal

Khalid and Garrett will be creating a python program in which the user will be asked if they prefer the average or sum process more. If they answer with average, a function will find the average of 5 randomly generated numbers. The same will happen for sum. If they answer with an invalid input, one of the 2 operations will happen randomly, with a 1/3 chance for average and a 2/3 chance for summation.

Garrett will make the main body of the program, Khalid will be responsible for the average and sum functionality.
